# Code Showcase 5

This repo is for displaying the things I have learned to code and concepts grasped for coding in Javascript, EJS, Mongoose, MongoDB and using responses, requests, promises, NPM packages. Each file will contain comments that explain the code I used and my thinking behind it.

### Sample_Blog

This app is designed to deploy locally and use store and serve blog posts from MongoDB. *Uses JS, Node, Express, NPM, Resp, Req, Promises, Parsers, and MongoDB.* Keys have been removed.

**Desired output:** A locally hosted app that will allow you to create, remove, and view blogposts.

### testMongoose

This app was deployed locally for my first tests and understanding of use with Mongoose. *Uses Express, Node NPM, Resp, Req, Promises, Parsers, and Mongoose.*

**Desired output:** A locally hosted app that will preform basic actions with Mongoose.

### To_Do_List_V1

This app was deployed locally to build a sample To_Do_List. *Uses Express, Node NPM, Resp, Req, Promises, Parsers, and Mongoose.*

**Desired output:** A locally hosted app that will allow for edge user to make to do list items and delete them.

#### Markdown, Git CLI, and Github

This document also displays a basic understanding of Markdown. Additionally the repo was create on Github, but the versioning and remote push were all executed from the CMD line with Git.
